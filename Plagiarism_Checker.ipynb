At first, you must by very clear in your objectives to be achieved. Finally, you should enjoy the overall process rather than the final outcome. There is no shortcut to success.

Besides working on your goals that would lead a person towards success it is very important to push your limit every day, take charge of your life, and keep learning. This experience enables us to think smartly to solve a critical problem and achieve success. It is very important to take care of your mind which could be done by eliminating negative thoughts and negative people from your life.
